## 2026-09-24 — Git migration — Codex owns this task

- Branch: `codex/tennis-git-migration-2026-09-24`, based on GitHub `main`
  `cc765097404aedd8d7412705a2dca2fe4e23ca89`.
- Eoin authorised migration after verified preservation. Production release
  still requires “ship it” for the exact named preview version.
- Canonical directory stays in place. All 214 existing file hashes matched
  immediately after Git initialisation. GitHub-only `tactical-lab.html` is
  retained under `Legacy Versions/GitHub-main-cc76509/`, outside deployment.
- Baseline: 224/224 tests pass; all 30 reviewed dependency hashes match.
  Existing live deployment: `dpl_EBEYezrjLafgyLZcF2RC1JSHK2Px`.
  Vercel Git branch `main`; automatic custom production domains disabled,
  freshly verified through the authenticated API on 24 September.
- Scope: publish the current source and existing history on this task branch,
  document the settled release/handoff procedure, enable exact Git preview
  targets in verification tools, prove Git deployment boundaries and parity.
- Status: in progress. No main push, merge, production release or Desktop
  reconciliation authorised by this log. No second agent writes this checkout.
