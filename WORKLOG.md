# GameSharp Tennis shared worklog

## 2026-09-24 — Git migration — Codex owns this task

- Branch: `codex/tennis-git-migration-2026-09-24`, based on GitHub `main`
  `cc765097404aedd8d7412705a2dca2fe4e23ca89`.
- Eoin authorised migration after verified preservation. Production release
  still requires “ship it” for the exact named preview version.
- Canonical directory stays in place. All 214 existing file hashes matched
  immediately after Git initialisation. GitHub-only `tactical-lab.html` is
  retained under `Legacy Versions/GitHub-main-cc76509/`, outside deployment.
- Baseline: 224/224 tests pass; all 30 reviewed dependency hashes match.
  Existing live deployment: `dpl_EBEYezrjLafgyLZcF2RC1JSHK2Px`.
  Vercel Git branch `main`; automatic custom production domains disabled,
  freshly verified through the authenticated API on 24 September.
- Scope: publish the current source and existing history on this task branch,
  document the settled release/handoff procedure, enable exact Git preview
  targets in verification tools, prove Git deployment boundaries and parity.
- Status: in progress. No main push, merge, production release or Desktop
  reconciliation authorised by this log. No second agent writes this checkout.

### Verification checkpoint

- First Git commit `9ab9ffa4905f17f8177187d880ccb1ba9e401245` pushed and
  verified. GitHub `contracts` and `Vercel` checks passed. Preview:
  `dpl_8X7TroxcgHeKDtaisWYBFpgaRzgq`,
  https://gamesharp-tennis-hg0mhfwb8-eoinlynn-5978s-projects.vercel.app .
- 46 static/dependency files retain canonical content. Preview HTML receives
  only Vercel's identified 163-byte Feedback script. All six retired pages,
  query variants, 28 eligible shares and 22 withheld/unknown share probes pass.
- All nine Predict journeys pass at 320×844 and 430×844 (18 runs), including
  both Live branches, Focus, immutable results and exact Playbook destinations.
  No reported document overflow; final browser errors empty. Representative
  screenshot inspection supports this automated walk, not physical-device or
  independent coaching certification.
- The first Git preview exposed `.github/workflows/checks.yml`. Add only
  `.github/` to deployment exclusions. Independent scoped review found all prior
  rules and the other 29 reviewed dependencies unchanged. Update only that
  configuration fingerprint with the review record; verify the new hosted 404
  before presenting the candidate as complete.
- Independent review also moved the domain-assignment/rollback-baseline safety
  check before the merge, so a changed setting cannot release prematurely.
- Court-check browser checks in progress. GitHub browser sign-in is needed to
  create the PR and enforce branch protection. Main remains the unchanged August
  commit, unprotected; no merge or production cutover has occurred.
